   - Using a default constructor
   - Using a parameterized constructor
- Accessor/Mutator Methods
- Pseudo Random Numbers (with exclusive upper bounds)
- Methods and passing objects to/from them
- While loops
- If/Else
- Constants
- Try/Catch
- Overriding the toString Method on a class
- the keyword *this*
